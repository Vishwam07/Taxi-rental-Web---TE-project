# Taxi-rental-Web---TE-project
This project was made when I was in Third year of my Engineering
A taxi Rental Website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySql and PHP was developed to provide convenient platform
for customers to book taxis for their transportation needs. The project has 4 modules- Admin panel, Booking module,
GIS and mapping Integration, and User Registration and Authentication.
â€¢ User can create account, login securely and manage their profile. User can book a taxi for specific date, time and
location by giving pickup drop-off locations. Admin can view, edit, delete and manage the users, drivers and taxis.
